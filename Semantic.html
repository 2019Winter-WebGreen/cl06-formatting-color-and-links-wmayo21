            <p> Adolph Levitt was the first person to have a donut machine. He created it for his donut shop in New York City, the year 1920. However, the idea didn't spread until 1931 when the machines became more refined. As time went on their was more competition in the donut world. Nutritionist were discouraged by the amount of people buying donuts because the calories were so high. However, people loved them and bought them because they tasted so good.</p><!-- Some history about donuts -->
            
            <p> While no one really knows when doughnuts were invented or who invented them, doughnuts were originally made as a long twist of dough.

It was also common in England for donuts to be made in a ball shape and injected with Jam after they were cooked. </p> <!-- Some more history about donuts -->
